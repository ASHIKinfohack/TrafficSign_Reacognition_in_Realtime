Traffic Sign Recognition and Auditory Alert System

The Traffic Sign Recognition and Auditory Alert System is a real-time application designed to enhance road safety by accurately identifying traffic signs and providing auditory alerts to drivers. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detection and a Text-to-Speech (TTS) module for notifications, this system ensures drivers are promptly informed about traffic signs, improving their situational awareness and decision-making.
